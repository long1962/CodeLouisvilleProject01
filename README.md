My First web page design Project

This is my first repository for my Code Louisville website project. The website is for a friend of mine that started new BBQ restaurant a couple of years ago. 
So far I have added three HTML pages as a sample outline and only very basic CSS.  There will be more to come as I progress through the Code Louisville Front End Track program.
